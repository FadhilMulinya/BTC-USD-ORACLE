The TokenICO contract is a decentralized token vending mechanism that facilitates the automated minting of ERC-20 tokens in exchange for ETH, leveraging Chainlinkâ€™s decentralized price feed oracle for real-time ETH/USD exchange rate computation.

Upon receiving ETH via the receive() function, the contract dynamically determines the equivalent token amount based on a predefined USD price per token, adjusted for Chainlink's 8-decimal precision. The token issuance is delegated to an external TokenInterface-compliant contract, invoking its mint function to transfer newly minted tokens to the purchaser.

Additionally, the contract enforces ownership-controlled liquidity management, enabling the owner to withdraw accumulated ETH through a secure access modifier. This architecture ensures trustless, real-time token pricing, scalability, and secure fund custody.
